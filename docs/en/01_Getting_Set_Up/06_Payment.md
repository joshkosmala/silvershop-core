Online payment is a critical part of any ecommerce solution. This module makes use of the PHP Omnipay payment library, which does a great job of standardising online payments.

This module integrates with the omnipay library via the [SilverStripe-Omnipay module](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-omnipay). It is automatically required by the shop module, via composer.

This Omnipay presentation gives a general overview to online payments and integrating omnipay with SilverStripe: http://jeremyshipman.com/blog/my-2c-on-omnipay-integrating-with-silverstripe/

## Available payment types

There are many [gateways](https://github.com/thephpleague/omnipay#payment-gateways) available, which you can install separately. Note that currently this module uses version 2.x of the Omnipay library.

The best way to find additional Omnipay payment drivers is perhaps to do a search on Packagist: https://packagist.org/search/?q=omnipay
